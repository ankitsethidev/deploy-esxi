This script uses the Cisco IMC / Redfish REST interface to control virtual media, boot order, and power state.
The CIMC must be able to reach the ISO file by URL (HTTP/HTTPS) OR you must upload the ISO to an available virtual media location the CIMC supports.
For unattended installation youâ€™ll need a VMware Kickstart file (ks.cfg) and either: (A) inject it into the ISO (build a custom ISO), (B) host it on HTTP/NFS and pass ks= boot parameter to the ESXi installer
